**JavaScript Data Structures Implementation**

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in JavaScript, aiming to deepen understanding and provide practical examples for learning. Each data structure is implemented with clear explanations and usage examples, making it suitable for educational purposes and practical applications.

**Included Data Structures:**

- **Linked List**: A fundamental linear data structure where elements are stored sequentially, facilitating efficient insertion and deletion operations.

- **Stack**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure that allows elements to be added and removed from the same end, commonly used in parsing algorithms and backtracking problems.

- **Queue**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure used for managing data in sequential order, crucial in simulations and scheduling tasks.

- **Binary Search Tree**: A hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, enabling efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

- **Hash Table**: A data structure that maps keys to values, offering rapid data lookup and insertion, ideal for implementing associative arrays and caches.

- **Graph**: A non-linear data structure consisting of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections), essential for modeling networks and relationships between entities.
